# Terminal

The Plansys2 Terminal module is a tool to directly monitor and edit your application. See the tutorial [here](https://github.com/IntelligentRoboticsLabs/ros2_planning_system/blob/master/plansys2_docs/tutorials/tut_1_terminal.md). 

The node is created inside a Terminal object, which starts a looping run_console() method reading the terminal input and calling the corresponding services and actions.
